I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Multispectral Information Processing, School of Electronic Information and Communications, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China. I received my Master of Engineering degree from [Southwest University](https://www.swu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China, in 2023. My research interests include Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

I have published papers in leading journals and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (T-GRS), IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE), IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (J-STARS), International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics (IJMLC), and ICDM 2025.

In addition, I also serve as a reviewer for several prestigious conferences and journals. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, you can contact me via email: [like@hust.edu.cn](like@hust.edu.cn).
